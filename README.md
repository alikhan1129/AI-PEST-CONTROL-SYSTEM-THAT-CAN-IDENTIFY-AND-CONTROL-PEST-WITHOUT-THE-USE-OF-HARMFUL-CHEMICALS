# 🐛 Pest Detection & Pesticide Recommendation System

This project is an **AI-powered pest identification system** with **natural pesticide recommendations**.  
It uses a **MobileNetV2** deep learning model and has:
- **Flask backend API** for pest detection.
- **Flutter mobile frontend** for user interaction.
- A dataset of pest images and natural pesticides.
